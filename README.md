# Front-End-CL-Project

**Summary:** This is a website built for my friend's hair salon. It has multiple pages, a main javascript and CSS external sheet. The content primarily consists of placeholder info. 

**Im going to list below requirements and how they are met.**

1.  **Resposive:** There is bootstrap source code present as well as a media query in the CSS sheet.

2.  **3 CSS classes:** Plenty of classes are applied to page elements, to name at least 3 I customly added; "wrapper" "push" and "nav-center". 

3.  **Javascript:** The main.js sheet has a single function that opens a new window when a button is pressed on the front home page.

4.  **Comments:** I commented on many sections to try and make the code easy to digest.

5.  **Github:** yes.

6.  **README:** You are reading me.

*To Dos (for the immediate future)

- Presentation: on many pages I need to clean up and get higher quality photos to use, cleaner font, tune colors to please the eyes.

- Improve consistency.

- Replace place holders with actual information.
